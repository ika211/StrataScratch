My Solutions to SQL practice questions on StrataScratch website

The queries for table creation are in **stratascratch_table_creation.sql**.
Initially I used to insert the records from Query which was not quite easy.
Later I realised that I can copy the records from table in browser and paste it in the DataGrip(IDE I currently use).
Hence after a few INSERT queries in table_creation sql script, you might notice only CREATE statements. 

The solutions for various queries is present in the **stratascratch_solutions.sql**.
These are my solutions and are not the only/fastest solution out there.
